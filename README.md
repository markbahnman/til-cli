# til-cli
A command line tool to easily create a repo of TILs. Inspired by https://github.com/jbranchaud/til

## About

This is a simple command line tool to make creating of little memos of things you learn throughout your day. Use a one off command for something that's neat? Why not create a TIL for it.

Right now this repo is not stable and is quite limited in functionality and scope - use at your own discretion.

## Installation and Usage

```bash
npm install -g til-cli
```

From there run ```til``` to both setup your repository and create new TILs

## Plans for the future
* Tests
* Better error handling
* Commands for editing TILs
* Hooks to automatically push repo
* Make it easy to hook into a static website generator such as gh-pages
